## Description
Conversa is an online community using several different technologies including Socket.io, Handlebars, Bootstrap, Node express, Sequelize, Dot Env, Bcrypt, Express Session, MySQL, Mockaroo and Javascript.<br>
It has both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. New packages used are Socket.io and Mockaroo.<br>
The folder structure meets the MVC paradigm and uses authentication. Dot Env protects API keys and sensitive information. It has been deployed using Heroku, has a very polished UI/UX and is responsive/interactive.<br>
It has good-quality coding standards such as file structure, naming conventions, indentation and quality comments.<br>
The README is professional with a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application.<br>

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Springhill Suites, which is where I did most of the work for this homework.  The room was gross and noisy, the workkspace adequate and the carpet was so gross I had to put my shoes on to use the rest room.  I was able to get extra towels, though.  It's good to be alive.
